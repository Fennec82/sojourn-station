The Blackshield logo flashes on the news prompter before the image of a Krosian with a light gray fur pattern adorned in a sergeant uniform popped on the screen.  His attire was decorated in numerous honors related to expeditions carried out under Blackshield duty. 
<br><br>
</i>
"Greetings, This is Sergeant Frost.  The goal of this news operation first and foremost is to get eyes up here on the upper colony for surface operations."
<br><br>
<i>
Frost holds up a small stack of papers and sighs
</i>
<br><br>
"We can't get everything done under budget anymore and we’ve worked with consultants from Lonestar and a think tank of Soteria's finest budget auditors to come up with an eloquent solution to our current lack of manpower.  Truth be told, our main goal was making the surface operations as constant as can be. This over the recent times has failed more and more, thus we are trying-" *the next part is said through gritted teeth showing utter disdain* "- A field operation using pre-authorized shuttle usage."
<br><br>
Frost then pinches their nose and sighs before calmly showing on screen a few graphs and photos of Ameridian fissures located in dark treacherous caves, the floors and walls shimmering from the sheer amount of Ameridian across the ground.   
<br><br>
"As seen in our detailed reports… ...that is within bounds for public release." Frost says cold and dry "This operation's goal is to destroy a majority, if not completely erase the growth of Ameridian in this sector of Amethyn." Frost pauses a moment as a new chart and Soteria’s logo appears next to a hypothesis paper [Of Ameridian in Local Caves and Growths connection to the planetary fissures] "According to studies from Soteria, doing so will lead to a decrease in Ameridian growths inside Lonestar Shipping caves and in the local surface forest for some time."

Frost then puts the report on top of the bundle before moving the stack from one side to the other, facing the camera to complete their brief.
</i>
<br>
<br>
"This will be the first of hopefully many joint operations between the surface employees and Blackshield Expedition Intel Teams."
<br><br>
<i>
The ending of the news segment is a jumpcut to a Blackshield logo before slowly fading out as credits of different sources and scientists scroll quickly and disclaimers about the study are released

<br>
<br>
The aged Sergeant briefly tapped a stack of papers bundled together in hand before his attention seemed to snap up.  Clearing his throat, the Krosian spoke up
</i>
“Greeting Nadezhda Colony, this is Sergeant Frost.  This is a report to follow up on the BSET Nadezhda Colonist joint operation.”
<br>
<br>
<i>
In a show of cheer and perhaps appealing to the younger viewers to draw inspiration, Sergeant Frost turned over his report to show a very clear text of: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
<br>
<br>
The aged Krosian looked sternly into the camera, his long snout nearly straight on and not quite giving the look of authority he thought it might give as his words certainly came with a heavier tone than the light hearted banter prior.
</i>
<br>
<br>
“That said… if the colonists accompanying BSET could keep within mission perimeters without ‘explosively’ adding in new ideas, we could see more missions being underway.  For now, Guild has been digging for days and Lonestar is funding the operation as they pile up the crystals for refining.”
<br>
<br>
<i>
Neatly placing the paper stack back down, the Krosian signed off with a wave
</i>
<br>
<br>
“We will be in touch Nadezhda, good work out there, just keep the explosives at home next time… if you absolutely need them we’ll provide them.  BSET Sergeant Frost out” 
<br>
<br>
<i>
The news prompter goes dark for a few seconds as the Blackshield logo appears, then suddenly goes dark before a moment later the news prompter blips back up with a rushed Cinderite intern with burnt orange colored scales screaming into the mic
</i><br><br>
“Ayanda Mwangi statess that Sspace Carp migrationss sstill occur, pleasse keep all picnicz within the gate wallss!”
</i><br><br>
<i>
Then finally, the news prompter goes to a jumpcut of the Blackshield logo before slowly fading out.
